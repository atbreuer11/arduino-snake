# Arduino Snake

This is an implementation of the classic snake game using an ardunio and an led array, controlled by a joystick.

[LED Array](https://www.amazon.com/SainSmart-MAX7219-Display-Control-Arduino/dp/B00NDVTT3W/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1480520096&sr=8-3&keywords=red+dot+matrix+led)
| [Joystick](https://www.amazon.com/Joystick-Module-Arduino-Atomic-Market/dp/B00WH89RTS/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1480520217&sr=8-7&keywords=arduino+joystick)

The LED array is controlled by [this library](https://github.com/wayoda/LedControl).

In the schematic, the wires on the right would connect to the 8x8 led array, and I used a joystick instead of two pontentiometers.
